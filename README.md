# Project3EO
Just learnt C++ so I want to write something with it. 
I don't know who will see this, but it is something from some universities of Hong Kong. 
I was trying to recreate orientation activities of universities of Hong Kong, based on what I remember. 
Files: 
1. Individual C++ source file, executable for each part of the project (Project3EO_xx)
2. One project that needs a Makefile to work (Other files with title of individual parts)
I am still working on the files that requires a Makefile to work. That would take some time, so for now try the individual files.
